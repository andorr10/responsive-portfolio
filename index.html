      <p>I don't know if you know this, but Andrew Orr is kind of a big deal.  Many people know him. He is very important.  He has many leather bound books and his apartment smells of rich mahogony.</p>

      <p>In all seriousness, I'm a SoCal Native who decided to uproot his life to take some coding bootcamp in the midlle of Texas.  Looking forward to diving deep into many coding languages and enjoying the craft beer around Austin.</p>

      <p>Some of my hobbies include working out, traveling, board games (Settlers of Catan!) and playing beach volleyball which will be the hardest part about leaving the sunny coast of california.</p>
